I consider myself a persistent person in learning new disciplines and very applied at work, someone who pays close attention to detail, and passionate about computer science and technology.

I often develop projects and applications in my free time, you can find some of them in my GitHub profile.\nI am currently looking for a job and open to listen any offer, even if they are not near my area. Someday, I desire to move to another city or even live abroad, since I think both life and work are an experience and each ingredient is in a place.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://danielRV7.github.io/author/daniel-ruiz-villa/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/daniel-ruiz-villa/","section":"authors","summary":"Hi!
